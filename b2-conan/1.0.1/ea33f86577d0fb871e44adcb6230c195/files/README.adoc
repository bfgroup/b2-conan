== Overview

A Conan utility to help, and adapt, Conan building to run B2 as needed.

== How To Use

Using this utility is simple using the
link:https://docs.conan.io/en/latest/extending/python_requires.html[`python_requires`]
Conan facility.

[source,python]
----
from conans import ConanFile, tools

required_conan_version = ">=1.44.0"


class Package(ConanFile):
    name = "my_package"
    tool_requires = ("b2/[>=4.7.0]@")
    python_requires = ("b2-conan/1.0.0@bfgroup/b2-conan")
    source_subfolder = "source_subfolder"

    def build(self):
        b2 = self.python_requires["b2-conan"].module.B2(self)
        sources = os.path.join(self.source_folder, self.source_subfolder)
        with tools.chdir(sources):
            b2.build()
----

That, when used in your own package that is based on
link:https://www.bfgroup.xyz/b2/[B2] will run B2 with the options needed to
match the Conan build variation.

The  `B2.build` takes a couple of arguments to further control what gets built
and how:

[source,python]
----
def build(self, args=None, build_dir=None, target=None)
----

* `args` (Optional, Defaulted to `None`) Extra arguments to invoke B2 with.
* `build_dir` (Optional, Defaulted to `None`) The intermediate output build
  directory.
* `target` (Optional, Defaulted to `None`) A set of one or more targets to build.
  These are added to the command line invocation directly. And must use the B2
  target syntax.
